# British-Airways-Dashboard

### Overview
This data analysis project aims to provide insights into a dataset on reviews left by customers of British Airways. By analyzing various aspects of the data, we seek to identify trends, make data-driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of customers' experience with the company.

### Tools
- Excel
- Tableau

### Exploratory Data Analysis
The EDA involved exploring the review data to answer key questions, such as:

- What trends, if any, can be observed in customer satisfaction metrics over time?
- How do customer satisfaction metrics vary across different aircraft types?
- Which countries are most frequently represented in the reviews, and where are the highest ratings concentrated? 

### Findings
After investigating the previously established questions, a few different key insights were generated:

- The large drop in average score for most metrics in May of 2020, coincides with a large drop in the number of submitted reviews, a result of Covid travel restrictions.
- Overall Rating trend line shows a decline in customer satisfaction from 2016 to 2023.
- Entertainment and Food ratings were much lower than the Overall Rating, especially for the A319, A320, A321, A321neo, and the Boeing 767 aircraft.
- Entertainment and Food ratings were also much lower in the European Market compared to the North American Market.

### Research
Performed additional research in order to identify the root cause of our findings. Research explained that:

- In October of 2020, British Airways cut cash operating costs by 54%, indicating that the Overall Rating trend decline can likely be attributed to a lower quality service.
- In 2017, British Airways implemented a program that reduced the selection of in-flight food offerings and made them more expensive. Reading customer reviews confirmed that this was the reason for low scores.
- British Airways article showed that for in-flight entertainment they offered wifi and free access to Paramount+ movies and shows. However, reading customer reviews exposed that wifi connection is extremely unstable, and many of the older aircraft don't have working tv screens.

### Recommendations
By making a couple of changes in target areas, British Airways can make a big change in the customer experience, potentially reversing the negative trend KPIs have been indicating

- Food - British Airways can introduce a tiered system, allowing them to offer a wider selection of offerings at lower prices. For instance, they can have a free tier comprised of a wide range of small snacks, a middle tier for meals, and a luxury tier for more gourmet items.
- Entertainment - British Airways can update their older planes, allowing customers to make use of the Paramount+ access. Additionally they can make Starlink their internet provider, as it is much faster and more stable than traditional ground to air systems.
